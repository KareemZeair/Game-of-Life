**This repository is my assignment solution for a school course.**

- Open a terminal in the project directory in the src folder.
- To compile and run the Game of Life program, run `javac *.java` to compile the program and create class files.

- Run the following instruction with these arguments:
`java Life [number of iterations] [grid size] [S or R or P]`

Penta-decathlon Oscillator (enter P)
Simkin glider gun (enter S)
Random (enter R))

For example, you can run `java Life 200 80 S` to run the program for 
200 iterations using a grid size of 80, and an initial pattern of the
Simkin Glider Gun.

## What is the Game of Life?
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.[1] It is a zero-player game,[2][3] meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.
