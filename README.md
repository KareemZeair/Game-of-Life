**This repository is my assignment solution for a school course.**

- Open a terminal in the project directory in the src folder.
- To compile and run the Game of Life program, run `javac *.java` to compile the program and create class files.

- Run the following instruction with these arguments:
`java Life [number of iterations] [grid size] [S or R or P]`

Penta-decathlon Oscillator (enter P)
Simkin glider gun (enter S)
Random (enter R))

For example, you can run `java Life 200 80 S` to run the program for 
200 iterations using a grid size of 80, and an initial pattern of the
Simkin Glider Gun.
